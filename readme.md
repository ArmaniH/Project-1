*Tequila Trivia*

1. As a user I can click a button to begin trivia game
2. As a user I read trivia questions the website displays one at a time
3. As a user I can click potential answers to the trivia questions
4. As a user there is a visual indication when I choose the right answer
5. As a user after I select an answer another question appears on the screen with another set of potential answers
6. As a user I can see how many points I've earned from answering questions correctly
7. As a user I can click a button to restart game.

For my first project I decided to take a simple approach.  I first thought of what elements are involved in a Trivia game. I wrote down the different functions my code would need in order to implement those elements. I used JQuery and CSS build my game. I intended for a pop up image to display at the end of the game, but couldn't get it functioning the way I would have liked so I removed it.
